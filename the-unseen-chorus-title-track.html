          <p>
            Two of us but my eyes slipped away<br>
            Two of us but my hands couldn&#x27;t stay<br>
            In the glow of a phone in the steam of the night<br>
            I lost my way before the light
          </p>
          <p>
            I chased the shadows I fed the flame<br>
            I forgot his touch I forgot his name<br>
            Every lie every swipe every line<br>
            I thought it was hunger but it was mine
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ramble&#x27;s mine I sang before<br>
            But now I see it was a closing door<br>
            The hunger won the night was long<br>
            But silence never made me strong
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes I can host became my prayer<br>
            Bodies knocking but no one there<br>
            Pixels glow the endless scroll<br>
            It hollowed me it ate me whole
          </p>
          <p>
            Divorce came signed the papers fell<br>
            A thousand secrets I could not tell<br>
            But in that room I learned to say<br>
            Addict broken but here today
          </p>
          <p>
            One day at a time we make it home<br>
            One day at a time we&#x27;re not alone<br>
            I thought the night would never end<br>
            But now I rise I start again
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnt cookies waiting on a tray<br>
            A poster sighs one step today<br>
            I met his eyes across the room<br>
            And love returned to break the gloom
          </p>
          <p>
            We&#x27;re not supposed to but maybe we might<br>
            One little coffee one harmless night<br>
            We&#x27;re not supposed to but maybe it&#x27;s true<br>
            That breaking the rules was leading to you
          </p>
          <p>
            Ten years strong ten years true<br>
            Every scar now leads me back to you<br>
            Ten years long we found where we belong<br>
            Forever is here because of you
          </p>
          <p>
            Ten years strong ten years bold<br>
            Ten years and a lifetime to hold<br>
            Ten years strong ten years true<br>
            Ten years and I still choose you
          </p>
          <p>
            One day at a time we make it home<br>
            One day at a time we&#x27;re not alone<br>
            The unseen chorus sings through me<br>
            A thousand voices history
          </p>
          <p>
            One day at a time the night is gone<br>
            One day at a time I carry on<br>
            The chorus fades but I remain<br>
            Alive with love alive again
          </p>
          <p>
            And tonight I am home
          </p>
