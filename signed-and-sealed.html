          <p>
            An envelope addressed to me<br>
            What could it be
          </p>
          <p>
            It is therefore ordered and decreed<br>
            That the marriage between us<br>
            Is dissolved
          </p>
          <p>
            Dissolved like sugar in the rain<br>
            Dissolved like love was just a stain<br>
            I gave you years I gave my name<br>
            And now it&#x27;s paper all the same
          </p>
          <p>
            Signed and sealed the end of us<br>
            Stamped in ink erased the trust<br>
            Signed and sealed my heart confined<br>
            A love reduced to dotted lines<br>
            Signed and sealed signed and sealed
          </p>
          <p>
            And the parties are restored<br>
            To the status of single persons
          </p>
          <p>
            Restored restored to what I was<br>
            A boy who begged for love because<br>
            I thought a vow could make me whole<br>
            But now a stamp divides my soul
          </p>
          <p>
            Signed and sealed the fire&#x27;s gone<br>
            The judge says over just move on<br>
            Signed and sealed the ink won&#x27;t dry<br>
            No court can see how hard I cry<br>
            Signed and sealed signed and sealed
          </p>
          <p>
            How can paper kill what fire once swore<br>
            How can a line erase what I&#x27;m living for<br>
            How can a seal mean love&#x27;s undone<br>
            Was I a husband or just someone
          </p>
          <p>
            Signed and sealed the page is torn<br>
            A life erased a love forlorn<br>
            Signed and sealed my name erased<br>
            I&#x27;m just a ghost in your empty space
          </p>
          <p>
            Signed, sealed, done...
          </p>
