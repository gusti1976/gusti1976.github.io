          <p>
            So uh do we order dessert first or talk about the weather<br>
            Shaking hands with paper sheets<br>
            Water rings on table stands<br>
            I laugh too loud he stares too long<br>
            The silence feels like something&#x27;s wrong
          </p>
          <p>
            I said once in the park I chased anyone who&#x27;d look at me<br>
            Didn&#x27;t care about their name<br>
            Didn&#x27;t care if they were kind<br>
            Just bodies in the dark
          </p>
          <p>
            He said I learned how to lie with a smile<br>
            Told my husband I was working late<br>
            While I was bent over in a stranger&#x27;s car<br>
            Sometimes three four in a night
          </p>
          <p>
            I said there were bathhouses where I stayed till dawn<br>
            Drunk on sweat on moans echoing through the steam<br>
            I thought if I kept moving I&#x27;d never have to feel empty
          </p>
          <p>
            He said I kept numbers in a hidden phone<br>
            A hundred men I never called back<br>
            Each one just a notch<br>
            And every notch cut me deeper than the last
          </p>
          <p>
            Secrets shared across this wine<br>
            Scars and stains but they are mine<br>
            No shame no mask just stories true<br>
            I&#x27;m broken and so are you
          </p>
          <p>
            But maybe broken fits together
          </p>
          <p>
            We wore the hunger like second skin<br>
            We fell we failed we let it win<br>
            But sitting here your eyes on me<br>
            The past is past and I&#x27;m finally free
          </p>
          <p>
            Secrets shared became our song<br>
            We thought it shame but we were wrong<br>
            Each mistake a road we knew<br>
            Each confession led me here to you
          </p>
          <p>
            And then we kissed
          </p>
