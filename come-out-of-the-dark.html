        <h2>About the Song</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>"Come Out of the Dark"</strong> is a powerful theatrical anthem from
          <em>The Unseen Chorus (A Gay Musical)</em>, addressing the profound themes of
          <strong>coming out, addiction recovery, and breaking free from shame</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The song carries a <strong>dual message of liberation</strong>: it speaks to both
          the LGBTQ+ experience of coming out of the closet and the universal struggle of
          coming forward about addiction, illness, and mental health challenges. With the
          powerful declaration <em>"The illness isn't who you are - You're a fire you're a star,"</em>
          the song refuses to let shame define anyone's identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Written and composed by <strong>Agust Smari Bjarkarson</strong> for his groundbreaking
          gay musical <em>The Unseen Chorus</em>, this song addresses gay community challenges
          including substance abuse, HIV/AIDS stigma, mental health struggles, and the courage
          it takes to seek help and live authentically.
        </p>
        <p>
          The memorable line <em>"Closets are for costumes not for your truth"</em> perfectly
          encapsulates the show's message: whether you're hiding your sexuality, your struggles,
          or your story - it's time to step into the light and own your truth.
        </p>

I see you hiding low
No shame in your story
Let the whole world know

We've all got secrets
We've all got scars
We've danced in shadows
Chased the wrong stars

But baby the truth it sets you free
No sickness owns your destiny

Don't be quiet
Don't disguise
Don't let the fear live in your eyes
Step into the light take a stand
Your story's power is in your hands

Come out come out of the dark tonight
No shame no chains just shining bright
The illness isn't who you are
You're a fire you're a star
Come out come out come out
Come out tonight

So what if you stumbled
So what if you fell
Every saint has a sinner's tale to tell
Addiction's a thief but it don't define
Raise your voice this life is mine

Don't be quiet
Don't disguise
Don't let the shame live in your eyes
Step into the light sing it loud
You've got a chorus you've got a crowd

Come out come out of the dark tonight
No shame no chains just shining bright
The illness isn't who you are
You're a fire you're a star
Come out come out come out
Come out tonight

Closets are for costumes not for your truth
So step out shine out we're living proof

Come out come out of the dark tonight
No shame no chains just shining bright
The illness isn't who you are
You're a fire you're a star
Come out come out come out
Come out tonight

Now go live your life and take a bow</pre>

        <h2>Musical Context: The Unseen Chorus</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>"The Unseen Chorus (A Gay Musical)"</strong> is a groundbreaking theatrical work by
          Agust Islandia that addresses the challenges, struggles, and triumphs within the gay community.
          Unlike many LGBTQ+ narratives that focus solely on romance or coming out, this musical tackles
          the "unseen" struggles: addiction, mental health, HIV stigma, and community healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Track 27, "Come Out of the Dark" serves as a pivotal moment in the show - a rallying cry
          for anyone hiding their truth, whether in the closet about their sexuality or suffering in
          silence with addiction or illness. The song's theatrical power comes from its direct address
          to the audience member "in the back row" - speaking to anyone who feels invisible or ashamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The musical represents Agust Smari Bjarkarson's commitment to creating authentic queer narratives
          that don't shy away from difficult topics, offering both representation and hope.
