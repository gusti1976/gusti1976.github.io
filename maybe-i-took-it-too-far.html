          <p>
            He said you&#x27;re cute let&#x27;s meet tonight<br>
            I thought maybe this time I&#x27;ll get it right
          </p>
          <p>
            Shower steam a borrowed smile<br>
            It&#x27;s been so long it&#x27;s been a while<br>
            I light the room I set the scene<br>
            Pretend that I am seventeen
          </p>
          <p>
            But lips touch lips and nothing stirs<br>
            A body fails a heart that blurs<br>
            I try to rise but I fall apart<br>
            I can&#x27;t get hard I&#x27;ve lost the spark
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you mind if I watch something<br>
            Just while we kiss
          </p>
          <p>
            He pulled away his eyes went cold<br>
            His jacket on his story told<br>
            No thanks he said and closed the door<br>
            I sank down lower on the floor
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe I took it too far<br>
            Chased the screen forgot who we are<br>
            Maybe I took it too far<br>
            Now I&#x27;m broken where I should be scarred
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe I took it too far<br>
            Too many nights with an endless star<br>
            Maybe I took it too far<br>
            And now I don&#x27;t know who I am
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe I broke myself
          </p>
