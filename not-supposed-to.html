          <p>
            &quot;They said… don&#x27;t date in recovery<br>
            Well… he smiled at me&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnt cookies waiting on a tray<br>
            A poster sighs one step today<br>
            He said hi I&#x27;m Mark<br>
            I said hi I&#x27;m doomed<br>
            Both of us laughing across the room
          </p>
          <p>
            We&#x27;re not supposed to but maybe we might<br>
            One little coffee one harmless night<br>
            We&#x27;re not supposed to but tell me again<br>
            How rules get broken by beautiful men<br>
            We&#x27;re not supposed to not supposed to
          </p>
          <p>
            He said one day at a time<br>
            I said can we skip to mine<br>
            He rolled his eyes but grinned so wide<br>
            I felt the spark I thought had died
          </p>
          <p>
            They tell us no dating for a year<br>
            But what if it&#x27;s just dinner
          </p>
          <p>
            We&#x27;re not supposed to but maybe we will<br>
            Rules are for breaking and hearts can heal<br>
            We&#x27;re not supposed to but oh it feels true<br>
            I&#x27;m breaking the rules if it&#x27;s breaking with you<br>
            Breaking the rules breaking with you
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I&#x27;m gonna ask him out
          </p>
